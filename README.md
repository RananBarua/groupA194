# Group Project: Analysis of Wine Quality based on different alcohol level
## **Overview**
This project aims to analyze the relationship between the alcohol content in white wines and their quality ratings. We perform statistical tests to determine whether wines with low and high alcohol content differ in their quality. The analysis includes data exploration, hypothesis testing, and visualizations to present our findings.
## **Data Description**
The dataset used for this analysis is the Wine Quality Dataset for white wines, containing the following columns:

-**fixed acidity**: Level of acidity in the wine.
-**volatile acidity**: The degree of volatility in the wine.
-**citric acid**: Amount of citric acid present.
-**residual sugar**: Amount of sugar left after fermentation.
-**chlorides**: Amount of chlorides in the wine.
-**free sulfur dioxide**: Concentration of free sulfur dioxide.
-**total sulfur dioxide**: Total sulfur dioxide concentration.
-**density**: The density of the wine.
-**pH**: The pH level of the wine.
-**sulphates**: Amount of sulphates in the wine.
-**alcohol**: Alcohol content of the wine.
-**quality**: Quality rating of the wine, ranging from 0 to 10.
